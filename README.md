# Ember CRUD Example App

I created this app to show how one could create an Ember.js app without using Ember Data. For CRUD(created, read, update, delete) to be meaningful in any sense, we need to store the data somewhere, so I chose to use HTML5 localStorage. 

## Todo

### Foundation

- [x] - Use Ember App Kit
- [x] - Basic CRUD
- [x] - Imaging uploading
- [x] - Item list
- [] - Tests

### Details

- [] - Form verification
- [] - Breadcrumbs
- [] - Preloading data from remote JSON

### Advanced

- [] - Object relationships

**What else would you like to see here?**

If you get more advanced than this, then you should probably use Ember Data.
